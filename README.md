# [JSL09] Submission: Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension

## Personal Dashboard

## Introduction:
This project is a personalised dashboard that displays various information such as weather, cryptocurrency data, and a background image fetched from the Unsplash API.

## Features:
* Background Image: Fetches a random landscape-oriented nature photo from the Unsplash APIs and 
                    sets it as the background image of the document body.
* Author Display: Displays the author's name of the fetched image.
* Cryptocurrency Data: Fetches Dogecoin data from the CoinGecko API and displays it on the 
                       dashboard, including the current price, 24-hour high, and 24-hour low.
* Current Time: Updates the current time every second.
* Weather Information: Fetches weather data based on the user's geolocation and displays it, 
                       including the tempearture, city name, and weather icon.

## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Unsplash API
* CoinGecko API
* OpenWeatherMap API

## Usage:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the 'index.html' file in a web browser.


## Reflection

# Challenges Faced:
* Asynchronous Data Fetching: Implementing asynchronous data fetching using 'fetch' API in 
  JavaScript required handling promises and understanding async/await syntax.

# Lessons Learned:
* API Integration: Gained practical experience in integrating external APIs into web 
  applications and handling data retrieval and display.
* Error Handling: Learn effective error handling techniques, including try-catch blocks, to 
  manage exceptions and provide falllback solutions.
* Modular JavaScript: Understand the benefits of using modular JavaScript with the `type="module"` attribute, which allows for better organisation and maintance of code.

# Conclusion:
The Personal Dshboard project provided valuable insights into building interactive web applications that fetch and display real-time data from external APIs. It enhanced proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as problem-solving skills in addressing challenges related to data fetching and error handling.
